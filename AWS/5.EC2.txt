EC2:
    - Elastic Compute Cloud
    - Infrastructure as Service

    * EC2 - Renting Virtual Machine
    * EBS - Storing data on Virtual Machine (Elastic Block Store)
    * ELB - Elastic Loan Balancer
    * ASG - Auto Scaling Group 

    * Bootstrap using "EC2 user data" script
        - run once while instance first start
        - runs with root access


EC2 Instance Types:

    - Depends on usecase
    - Naming convension e.g m5.2xlarge
        - m: instance class
        - 5: generation
        - 2xlarge: size

    * General Purpose:
        - web servers, code repository
        - balanced
        - M/T series

    * Compute Optimized
        - Batch processing, Media transcoding, high performance web server, data analysis
        - C series

    * Memory Optimized:
        - Processes that loads large data in memory
        - Web scale cache, high performance db, In memory db optimization, big data
        - R series/X1/Z1

    * Storage Optimized:
        - Storage intensive tasks
        - Data warehouse, File system

Security Group:
    - network security
    - controls network traffic
    - contains only 'allow' rules
    - inbound (data coming in EC2) and outbound (data going out from EC2) traffic rules
    - rules can be referenced by IP or by other security groups

    - can be attached to multiple instance
    - Locked down to region/VPC combination

    - timeout means security group issue

    PORTS:
        - 22 : SSH
        - 21 : FTP
        - 22 : SFTP
        - 80 : HTTP
        - 443 : HTTPS
        - 3389 : RDP, Remote Desktop Protocol, log into a windows instance
 

SSH:
    $ chmod 0400 <pem cert>
    $ ssh -i <pem cert> ec2-user@<instance ip> #ec2-user is default user for amazon linux
        - eg: ssh -i /Users/rahat/Documents/Codes/AWS/udemy-aws-test-acct.pem ec2-user@51.20.83.32


IAM Role: 
    - Add IAM role to instance to use aws cli in EC2. 
    - AWS CLI needs access key permission which cannot be added to EC2 for security reasons


Buying options of EC2:
    - On demand: Pay as you use
    - Reserved Instances: Commit to specific instance for specific time, can be Convertible
    - Savings Plans: Commit to certain amount of usage for specific time
    - Spot instance: Uses beating system, can lose the instance to higher beat
    - Dedicated host: Book an entire physical server
    - Dedicated instance: No other customer will share the hardware 
    - Capacity Reservations: Reserve Capacity for any duration
