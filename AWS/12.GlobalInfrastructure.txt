Global Applications:
    - Global application is deployed in multiple Regions and/or Edge Locations
    - Decreased Latency
    - Disaster Recovery
    - attack protection

Route 53:
    - Managed DNS (Domain Name System)
    - DNS is a collection of rules and and records which helps clients to reach a server through URLs

    - common records:
        - domain => ipv4 : A record
        - domain => ipv6 : AAAA record
        - domain => domain: CNAME
        - domain => AWS resource: Alias

    - Policies:
        # Simple routing policies: (does not have health check)
        # Weighted routing policies: Server has weight and servers with more weight gets more requests
        # Latency routing policies: Route53 will find lowest latency
        # Failover routing policty: If server health check fails then it will route to another one

CloudFront:
    - managed CDN (Content Delivery Network)
    - Global service by using WAF & Sheild
    - Content is cached at the edge, 
    - Improves read performance, user experience
    - Gives DDos protection

    - Origins:
        # S3 Bucket:
            - for distributing files and caching them at the edge
            - can be used as ingress (to upload files to S3)
            - Security with Origin Acess Control (OAC) replacing origin access identity (OAI)
        
        # Custom Origin:
            - ALB
            - EC2 instance
            - S3 website
            - Any HTTP backend

    - CloudFront is great for static content that must be available everywhere
    - S3 cross region replication is great for dynamic content that need to be available at low latency in few
    regions

S3 Transfer Acceleration:
    - Increase transfer speed by transferring file to an AWS edge location which will forward the data to S3 bucket 
    in target region
    - File in USA =(public www)=>Edge location in USA =(private network)=> S3 Bucket 

Global Accelerator:
    - Improve application's availability and performance by using AWS global network
    - AWS uses the internal network to optimize routing
    - 2 Anycast IP are created

    - Client in USA <==> Edge Location <==> ALB in india

    - CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network that chaches the content
    Global network used AWS internal network to route the packet faster

Outposts:
    - "Server Racks" that offers same AWS infrastructure on premises
    - AWS will setup and manage "Outposts racks"

WaveLength Zones:
    - Infrastructure deployments embedded within the telecommunicaitons providers' datacenters at the edge of the
    5G network
    - Brings AWS services to the 5g network

LocalZones:
    - Extended Zones near to customer
    - Extend the VPC to more locations (AWS regions)
    - For latency sensitive applications

Global Application Architecture:
    # Single Region, Single AZ
        - Low Availability
        - High Global Latency
        - Low Dificulty

    # Single Resion, Muliple AZ
        - High availability
        - High global latency
        - midium difficulty

    # Multiple region, Active-Passive
        - Data replicaiton between Active and passive region (writes into one)
        - Improved read latency
        - Bad write latency
        - midium + 1 difficulty
    
    # Multiple region, Active-Active
        - Write/Read into multiple regions
        - Good read/write latency
        - Difficult to setup
