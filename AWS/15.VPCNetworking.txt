    - Virtual Private Cloud
    - Subnets: Tied to an AZ, network partition on the VPC

IPAddress in AWS:
    - Public IP: EC2 instance gets a new public ip everytime it restarts
    - Private IP: EC2 instances will have fixed private ip 
    
    - Elastic IP: (Static Public IP) Same public IP will be kept

VPC:
    - Private cloud to keep resources
    - Subnets: Allows you to partition your newtwork
    - Subnet that are connected to internet are called public otherwise private
    - NAT gateway and NAT Instances allow your instances in private subnet to access the internet while
    remaining private

NACL:
    - Network Access Control List: to secure VPC
    - Firewall that controls traffic from and to SUBNET
    - Rules only include IP address
    - Attached to Subnet level
    - Can have Allow/Deny rules (Security Group can only Allow rules)
    - Is stateless (Inbound and outbound rules are different streams) Security Group is statefull)

Security Group:
    - Firewall that controll traffic in and out from an EC2 instance
    - Can only have allow rules

Flow Logs:
    - All informatin about IP traffic

    * VPC Flow Logs
    * Subnet Flow Logs
    * Elastic Network Interface Flow Logs

    - Help to monitor connectivity issue

VPC Peering:
    - Connect two VPC privately using AWS network
    - Make them behave as if they were in current network

    - must not have overlapping CIDR(IP address range)

VPC Endpoint:
    - Endpoint allows you to connect to AWS services using a private networks
    - Enhanced security and lower latency

    Types:
        - VPC endpoint Gateway: S3 & DynamoDB (Public Domain Services)
        - VPC endpoint Interface: other services

Private Link:
    - run services within other VPC without VPC peering
    - Requires a Network Loan Balancer(service end) and Elastic Network Interface (customer end)

Hybryd VPC:
    # VPN:
        - Connect an on-premises VPN to AWS
        - Connection is automatically encrypted
        - goes through public internet
s
        - On-premises must use a Customer Gateway
        - AWS: must use a Virtual private gateway 

    # Direct Connect (DX):
        - Physical connection between on-premises and AWS
        - DEDICATED, Private, secure and fast connection

Client VPN:
    - Connect from your computer using OpenVPN to you private network in AWS and on-premises
    - Allows to use EC2 instances on private network

Transit Gateway:
    "How to connect thousands of VPC and on-premises together?"

    - For having transitive peering between thousands of VPC and on-premises, hub and spoke (star) connection
    - Works with direct connect gateway, VPN connections.
