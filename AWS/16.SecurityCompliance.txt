DDoS Attack Protection:
    - Distributed Denial of Service attack

    - AWS Sheild standard: 
        protection is turned on by default (common attacks)
    - AWS Sehled Advanced: 
        more expensive option (sophisticated attack)
    - AWS WAF: 
        - Web Application Firewall
        - Filter specific users based on rules 
        - Layer 7
        - Deploy on ALB, API gateway, CloudFront
    
    - CloudFront and route53: combined with shield and provides attack mitigation at the edge

Network Firewall Service:
    - Protect your entire VPC
    - From layer 3 to 7
    - you can inspect any direction

Firewall Manager:
    - Manage security rules of all accounts
    - Rules are applied to new resources as they are created across all accounts

Penetration Testing:
    - Penetration tests are allowed on 8 services without prior approval.
    - DoS, DDoS or other attacks are prohibited

Encryption:
    - Encryption at rest and in transit(when data moves)
    - Need encryption keys to encrypt
    - Auto encryption enabled: CloudTrail Log, S3, Glacier, Storage Gateway

    # KMS: 
        - Key management service
        - AWS manage encryption keys for us

        - Cutomer managed keys: Create/managed by customer
        - AWS managed keys: create/managed by AWS on customer behalf
        - AWS owned keys: Collection of CMKs what an AWS service owns and manages to use it in multiple account
        
    # CloudHSM:
        - KMS manages softwares for encryption
        - CloudHSM manages hardware for encryption
        - AWS will give us the hardware but we need to managed encryption by ourselves

AWS Certificate Manager (ACM):

        - DNS Logs
        - Optional features: RDS, Aurora, EBS Lambda, S3 data events
    - Can protect against crypto currency attack

Inspector:
    - Automated security assessments
    - Analyzes vulnerabilities for:
        * EC2 instances
        * Container images to push to ECR
        * Lambda functions

    - Continuous scanning for the infrastructure

Config:
    - Helps auditing and recording of configurations and changes over time
    - Posibility of storing configuration data into S3
    - Used to check compliance of the comfigurations
    - Questions that it answers:
        * is there unrestricted SSH access to security groups?
        * Do my buckets have any public access?
        * How has my ALB configuration changed overtime?

Macie:
    - Fully managed data security and privacy service
    - uses Machine learning to discover and protect SENSITIVE DATA (like PII) in AWS

    - S3 =Analyze=> Macie (discover sesitive data) =Notify=> Event Bridge =integration=> SNS/Lambda/...

Security Hub:
    - Certral security tool to manage security across multiple AWS accounts and automate security checks
    - Auto aggregate alerts in predefined or personal FINDINGS formats from various AWS services and AWS partner tools
    - Must enable AWS config service to make it work

Detective:
    - GuardDuty, Macie and security hub are used to identify potential security issues or findings
    - Detective analyze, investigates and quickly identifies the root cause of security issues if any
    - Helps to find root cause of security issue

Abuse:
    - Report suspected AWS resource used for abusive or illigal purposes
    - For example: Spam from AWS IP / DDoS attack

Root User Privileges:
    - Account owner
    - Has complete access to all AWS services and resources
    - Actions that can be performed by only root user

        * Register as a seller in the Reserved Instance Marketplace
        * Configure S3 to enable MFA
        * Edit/delete amazon S3 bucket policy that includes an invalid VPC ID or VPC endpoint ID
        * Sign up for GovCloud

IAM access analyzer:
    - Find out which resources are shared externally
    - Define Zone of Trust: AWS account/Organization
