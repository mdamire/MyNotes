Availability, Scalability, Elasticity:
    - Vertical Scalable:
        - Increase size of the instance
        - e.g t2.micro to t2.targe
        - for non distributed system like database

    - Horizontal Scalable (Elasticity):
        - increase number of instances/systems
        - for distributed system
        - need: auto scaling group & loan balancer

    - High availability:
        - running application at least 2 availability zones


Elastic Loan Balancing:
    - Load balancers forward internet traffic to miltiple servers
    - Exposes a single point of access (DNS) to the applicaiton
    - regular health check to instance

    - managed load balancer
    - can be possible to install own load balancer on 

    - 4 kinds of AWS load balancers:
        * Application loan balancer 
            - HTTP/HTTPS/gRPC protocols 
            - Layer 7
            - HTTP routing features
            - Static DNS (URL)

        * Network Load Balancer
            - high performance, 
            - TCP/UDP protocols 
            - Layer 4
            - Static IP through Elastic IP
        
        * Gateway load balancer 
            - GENEVE protocol on IP packets
            - Layer 3
            - e.g routing traffic to firewalls that you manage on EC2
        
        * Classic Load Balancer (retired in 2023) - Layer 4 & 7


Auto Scaling Group:
    - Goal:
        - Scale out to match increased load
        - Scale in to match a decreased load
        - Minimum and maximum number of machines running
        - automatically register new instances to a load balancer
        - replace unhealthy instances


ASG Strategies:
    - Manually Scaling: 
        - update ASG size manually
    
    - Dynamic Scaling:
        - Simple/Step Scaling: 
            * emaple when CPU > 70% then add 2 units
            * example when CPU < 30% then remove 1
        - Target Tracking Scaling:
            * Example: I want the average ASG CPU to stay at around 40%
        - Scheduled Scaling:
            * Emaple: increase capacity at 10 to 11 pm friday
    
    - Predictive Scaling
        * Uses machine learning to predict future traffic ahead of time
        * Auto sets right number of EC2 ahead of time
        * useful when loan has time based pattern
