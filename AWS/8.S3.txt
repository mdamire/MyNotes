- "infinitely scaling" storage
- example: Nasdaq stores 7 years of data into s3 Glacier
- example: Sysco runs analytics on it's data and gain business insights

Buckets:
    - stores files into buckets (top level directories)
    - must have a globally unique name
    - defined at region level
    - naming convention:
        * no uppercase, no underscore
        * 3-6e chars
        * must not ip
        * not start with xn--
        * not end with -s3alias

Objects:
    - objects are files
    - has a key which is the full path of the file
    - key is prefix(directory) + object name(file)
    - values are the content of the body
    - max 5TB, multipart for > 5gb
    - Metadata: list of text key value pairs
    - Tags: list of Unicode key value paris (upto 10)
    - has a version id


Security:
    # User based:
        * IAM Policies - specific users of IAM
    
    # Resource Based:
        * Bucket Policies - bucket rules allows cross account
        * Object Access Control List (ACL)
        * Bucket Access Control List (ACL)

    - Note: an IAM principan can access an S3 object if IAM permission allows it OR the resource policy allows it
    AND there is no explicit deny

    - Bucket policies are JSON based

    - Bucket policies are for:
        * Grant public access to the bucket
        * Force object to encrypt on upload
        * Grant access to another account
    
    - Use case:
        * Public access - use bucket policy
        * User access - IAM policies
        * EC2 instance access - IAM role policies
        * Cross Account Access - use bucket policy

    - "Block public access" bucket settings
        - to prevent data leak
        - overrides other policies
        - can be set account level


Versioning:
    - enabled in bucket level
    - same key overwrite will change the version
    - can be roll back
    - any file that is not versioned prior to enabling will have null version ID


Replication:
    # CRR: Cross Region Replication
    # SRR: Same Region Replication

    - Must enable versioning in source and destination buckets
    - bucket can be in different aws accounts
    - asynchronous copy
    - proper IAM permission to S3


Storage Classes:
    - can move between classes manually or using S3 Lifecycle configuration
    - Durability: How many times a object can be lost in a time frame
    - Availability: How regular the object is available

    # S3 standard - general purpose:
        - 99.99% availability
        - used for frequently accessed data
        - low latency and high throughput
        - sustain 2 concurrent facility failures
        - for big data analysis, mobile and gaming applications, content distribution

    # S3 Infrequent access:
        - for less frequent but rapid access
        - lower cost than s3 standard

        * Standard IA:
            - 99.9% availability
            - for disaster recovery, backups

        * One Zone IA:
            - high Durability
            - data lost when AZ is destroyed
            - 99.5% availability
            - For storing secondary backup, or data that can be recreated

    # S3 Glacier:
        - Low cost
        - For archive/backup
        - Pricing: price for storage + object retrieval cost

        * Instant Retrieval:
            - millisecond retrieval, great for data accessed once a quarter
            - minimum Storage 90 days
        
        * Flexible Retrieval:
            - Expedited (data back in 1 to 5 minutes), Standard (3 to 5 hours), Bulk (5 to 12 hours, free)
            - minimum Storage 90 days

        * Deep Archive:
            - long term storage
            - Standard(12 hours), Bulk(48 hours)
            - minimum storage 180 days
    
    # S3 Intelligent-Tiering:
        - Moves objects between Access Tiers based on usage
        - Small monthly monitoring and auto-tiering fee
        - no retrieval cost

        * Frequent Access tier(auto): default tier
        * Infrequent Access tier(auto): objects not accessed for 30 days
        * Archive Instant Access tier(auto): not accessed for 90 days
        * Archive Access Tier(optional): configurable from 90days to 700+ day
        * Deep Archive Access Tier(optional): 180 days to 700+ days


Encryption:
    - Server side: object is encrypted after uploading by server
    - Client side: object is encrypted before uploading by client


IAM Access Analyzer:
    - monitoring feature that ensures only intended people can access S3 bucket
    - Evaluates S3 bucket policies, S3 ACLs, S3 Access point policies


Snow Family:
    - Used for import/export of huge amount of data from AWS
    - These are physical devices that are shipped to client. Client can import/export data and send the device back.
    - Used to a huge data migrations like migrating a data center where data upload over internet will take a very long
    time

    * Snowcone:
        - Smaller device
        - Storage: 8TB HDD, 14TB SSD
        - Migrations: Upto 24TB online or offline

    * Snowball
        - Storage: 80TB
        - Migration: Upto petabytes offline

    * Snowmobile
        - Storage: < 100PB
        - Migration: up to exabytes offline
        - it's a truck
    
    # Edge computing:
        - Where internet is not available but generates data
        - AWS device can be set up to do edge computing
        - EC2 and AWS Lambda runs on these devices (using AWS IoT Gressgrass)

        * Snowcode & Snowcode SSD (smaller)
        * Snowball Edge - Compute Optimized
        * Snowball Edge - Storage Optimized
    
    - OpsHub software (gui) can be used to manage Snow family devices


Storage Gateway:
    - Bridge between on premise data and cloud data in S3
    - Hybrid storage allows seamless use of on premise data with could data

    - AWS storage native options:
        * Block: EBS, EC2 instance store
        * File: Amazon EFS
        * Object: S3, Glacier

    - Types of Storage Gateway:
        * File Gateway
        * Volume Gateway
        * Tape Gateway
