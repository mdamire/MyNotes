RDS:
    - Relational database server
    - Databases that use SQL
    - Storage backed by EBS

    # Advantage over DB on EC2:
        - Automated provisioning
        - Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp
        - Monitoring dashboard
        - Read replicas for improved read performance
        - Scaling capability
        - Multi AZ

    # Amazon Aurora:
        - proprietary db technology from AWS
        - PostgreSQL and MySQL are supported
        - Cloud optimized, 5x faster MySQL ans 3x PostgreSQL
        - auto storage increment by 10GB up to 128TB
        - 20% expensive than RDS but efficient

        - Aurora serverless:
            - auto db instantiation and auto scaling based on actual usage
            - least management overhead
            - for infrequent, intermittent or unpredictable workload
            - client is connected to Proxy Fleet and aurora instantiate and connect to it
            (serverless db decouple the part of the management system that deals with storage from the part that
            executes queries)


RDS Deployment options:
    * Read Replicas:
        - Creates replicas to read the DB
        - Scales the workload of DB
        - Data is only written to the main DB
        - Can create upto 15 read replicas

    * Multi-AZ:
        - Creates copy of db on another AZ for failover in case fo AZ outage
        - Can only be accessed in case of AZ fail
        - Can only have one other AZ as failover
        - App reads/writes to main db
    
    * Multi-Region (read replicas):
        - read replicas in multiple region
        - in case of regional issue
        - replication costs


ElastiCache:
    - in memory database, high performance, low latency
    - like RDS, it is managed cache like Redis or Memcache
    - AWS takes care fo OS maintenance/patching, optimizations, setup, configuration, monitoring, failure recovery and 
    backups


DynamoDB:
    - NoSQL db, fully managed, highly available with replication across 3AZ
    - distributed "serverless" db. means need to instantiate instead of creating a server
    - Fast, High Performance, 100s of TB of storage
    - low latency
    - Integrated with IAM for security authorization and administration
    - low cost and auto scaling capability
    - Standard and Infrequent Access table classes

    * DynamoDB Accelerator - DAX:
        - Fully managed in memory cache for DynamoDB
        - Only for DynamoDB, ElastiCache can be used for any DB
        - secure, fast, highly available and scalable

    * Global Tables:
        - make dynamo table accessible with low latency in multiple region
        - Global table can be created in mutiple regions and they will be in sync with each other.
        - User can read/write either of those, so will be accessed to the closest one
        - Active-Active replication (actively write any region and actively replicate to other regions)


Redshift:
    - Based on PostgreSQL, but it's not OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)
    - OLAP - online Analytics Processing (analytics and data warehousing)
    - Load data every hour, not every second
    - Columnar storage of data (instead of row based)
    - Massive Parallel Query Execution (MPP)
    - Has SQL interface
    - Business Intelligence(BI) tools integrated(AWS Quicksight or tableau)

    * Redshift Serverless:
        - workloads without managing data warehouse infrastructure
        - pay as you use
        - for Reporting, dashboarding applications, real-time analytics


EMR: ???
    - Elastic MapReduce
    - Helps creating hadoop clusters to analyze and process vast amount of data
    - the clusters can be made of hunderds of EC2 instances
    - also supports Apache Spark, Hbase, Presto, flink
    - Use cases: data processin, machine learning, web indexing, big data


Athena:
    - Serverless query service to perform analytics against S3 objects
    - SQL to query the files
    - supports csv, Json, ORC, Avro and Parquet (built on Presto)
    - use compressed or columnar data for cost-savings
    - Use case: BI/Analytics/reporting ...


Quicksight:
    - to create dashboard on databases to visualize the insights of data
    - Integrated with RDS, Aurora, Athena, Redshift, S3 ...


DocumentDB:
    - Aurora is an "AWS-implementation" of PostgreSQL/MySQL
    - DocumentDB is the same for MongoDB
    - Fully managed, hightly available and auto scallable (increments of 10GB, upto 64TB)
    - millions of request per second


Netune:
    - fully managed Graph database
    - A popular graph db is social network
    - Build and run applications working with highly connected datasets - optimized for these complex and hard queries.
    - can store upto billions of relations and query the graph with milliseconds latency
    - Great for knowledge graphs, fraud detection, recommendation engines, social networking


QLDB:
    - Quantum Ledger Database
    - A ledger is a book recording financial transactions
    - Fully managed, serverless, high available, replication accross 3AZ
    - Used to review history of all the changes made to your application data overtime
    - Immutable system
    - centralization component


Managed Blockchain:
    - blockchain makes it possible to build applications where multiple parties can execute transactions without the 
    need for a trusted, central authority. (decentralized)
    - Compatible with frameworks: Hyperledger Fabric & Ethereum


Glue:
    - Managed extract, transform and load (ETL) service
    - useful to prepare and transform data for analytics
    - fully serverless service
    - example, extracting data from S3 and RDS, transforming it and loading it to Redshift
    - Glue Data catalog: catlog of datasets, can be used by Athena, redshift ...


DMS:
    - Database Migrations Service
    - Source DB -> EC2 instance running DMS -> Target DB
    - Source database remains available during migration
    - Support Homogeneous migrations (MySQL to MySQL) or Heterogeneous migrations (MySQL to Oracle)
