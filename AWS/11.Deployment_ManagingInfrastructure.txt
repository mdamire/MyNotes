CloudFormation:
    - Declarative way of outlining AWS infrastructure
    - Infrastructure as a code

    - Resources are dynamically created, good for control
    - infrastructure is reviewed through code
    - estimate the costs using CloudFormation template

    - Ability to destry and re-create an infrastructure on the fly
    - Don't recreate the wheel - use existing templates and documentations on the web

CDK:
    - Cloud development kit
    - Define cloud infrastructure using programming language (will be compiled to CloudFormation code)
    - CDK CLI will convert code to define cloud infrastructure (as CloudFormation)

Beanstalk:
    - Developer centric view of deploying on AWS
    - all in one view
    - We still have full control over configuration
    - PaaS

    - Managed Service:
        - Instance configuration/OS 
        - Deployment strategy
        - Capacity provisioning
        - Loan balancing and auto-scaling
        - health-monitoring & responsiveness

    - Three architechture models:
        - Single instance
        - LB + ASG
        - ASG only : for non web applications (e.g workers)
    
    * Beanstalk is about code and cloudwatch is about infrastructure about code


# Code management related services:

CodeDeploy:
    - Works with EC2 instances (update code version in many ec2 instances)
    - Works with on premises servers
    - Hybrid service

    - Servers/Instances must be provisioned with CodeDeploy Agent

CodeCommit:
    - Git cloud like github
    - Fully managed
    - Private, Secured, Integrated with AWS servicess

CodeBuild:
    - Build code in cloud
    - Retrive code, Compiles source code, run tests, produce packages to deploy
    - Fully managed, serverless
    - Pay as you go

Code pipeline:
    - connect between steps for code
    - Code => Build => Test => Provision => Deploy

    - Fully managed, fast delivery & rapid updates

CodeArtifact:
    - Storing and retrieving dependencies
    - Works with common dependency management tools: Maven, Gradle, npm, pip
    - Developers can retrive dependencies from Artifact

CodeStar:
    - Unified UI for code related services

Cloud9:
    - Cloud IDE
    - Can be used within we browser, no need to install
    - Code colaboration, pair programming

AWS System Manager (SSM):
    - Helps you manage your EC2 and On-Premises system at scale
    - Hybrid system

    - Need to install SSM agent on EC2 and On-Premises systems
    - these agents will report back to SSM service in AWS

SSM Session Manager:
    - SSH to EC2 or on-premises servers without SSH access, bastion hosts or SSH keys
    - No port 22 needed. (better security)

    - User -> (IAM Permission) -> SSM Session Manager -> (Execute commands) -> EC2 instance with SSM agent

    - Service: System Manager -> Fleet manager (here all the VMs with SSM agent)
    - Service: System Manager -> Session manager (to ssh to VMs)

SSM Parameter Store:
    - Secure storage for configurations and secrets
    - Serverless Scalable
    - Control asscess using IAM

    - Service: System Manager -> Parameter Store

OpsWork:
    - Chef & Puppet: third party , for server configuration
    - Works with EC2 and on-premises VMs
    - AWS OpsWork = Managed Chef & Puppet
    - alternative to AWS SSM
