EBS:
    - Elastic Block Storage
    - "Network Drive" that can be attached to EC2 instances
    - Keeps data even after EC2 instance termination

    - Can be mounted to one EC2 instance at a time, except io1 and io2 type volumes
    - one EC2 instance can have multiple EBS

    - Bound to specific availability zone

    - "Delete on Termination" is default turned on for "Root" volume and turned off for other volumes
    - Measured by size and IOPS (IO per Seconds)


Snapshot:
    - Creates a backup
    - Can be copied across availability zones and regions

    # Archive
        - 75% cheaper when moved to archive tier
        - takes 24 to 72 hours to restore

    # Recycle Bin
        - Can be restored after delete
        - Specific retention (from 1 day to 1 year)


AMI:
    - Amazon machine image
    - Customization of EC2 instance
    - AMI build for specific region
    - Public, Own, Marketplace


EC2 Image builder:
    - Automate creation, maintain, validate and test EC2 AMIs
    - EC2 Image builder -> EC2 instance -> AMI -> Test EC2 instance -> AMI is distributed
    - Can be scheduled


EC2 Instance Store:
    - high performance than EBS 
    - it will be lost if instance is stopped
    - can be used as cache/temporary data/buffer etc


EFS:
    - Elastic file system for Linux based machine
    - NFS (network file system) that can be mounted to 100s of EC2
    - expensive, pay per use cost
    - shared through all availability zones in a region

    EFS-IA:
        - EFS infrequest Access
        - Storage class that is cost Optimized
        - EFS will move files to EFS-IA in the background according to Lifecycle policy


Shared Responsibility:
    AWS: 
        - Infrastructure
        - Replication for data for EBS volumes and EFS drives
        - Replace faulty hardware
        - Ensuring their employees cannot access data

    Customer:
        - setting up backup/snapshot procedure
        - Settting up data encryption
        - data on the drives
        - Risk of EC2 instance store


FSx:
    - High performance 3rd party file system on AWS
    - FSx for Windows file server:
        - Windows native shared file system
        - Build on windows file system
        - supports SMB and NTFS
    
    - FSx for Luster
        - for linux (linux and cluster)
        - For High performance computing

    - FSx for NetApp ONTAP
