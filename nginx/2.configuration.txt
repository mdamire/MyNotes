Terms:
    * Context:
        - Scope/Section in configuration
        - Nested and inherited from parent
        - e.g http {
            <directives>
        }
    * Directive:
        - Specific configuration options
        - consists name and value
        - e.g server_name mydomain.com;

Virtual Host:
    * Conf file:
        - linux: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf; mac: /opt/homebrew/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
        - server_name directive can have asterisk char like *.demo.com
        - context types { text/html html; }:  mime type text/html for html extension files
        - include <relative_path>; includes configuration from other file
    
    * Conf file:
    events {}
    http {
        include mime.types;
        
        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name localhost;
            root /Users/rahat/Documents/Codes/nginx/demo;
        }
    }

Location Block:
    - configuration of URI
    - Different ways of mathing:
        # Regex match case sensitive: e.g location ~ /greet[0-9]
        # Regex match case in-sensitive: e.g location ~* /greet[0-9]
        # Prefix match: anything that starts with the match. e.g location /greet
        # Preferential Prefix match: same as Prefix match but more important. e.g location ^= /greet
        # Exact match: e.g location = /greet
    - Order of matching: 
        1. Exact match: = uri
        2. Preferential Prefix Match: ^~ uri
        3. Regex match: ~ uri / ~* uri (whichever comes first)
        4. Prefix match: uri


    * Conf file:
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name localhost;
        root /Users/rahat/Documents/Codes/nginx/demo;
        location /greet {
            return 200 "Hello world
        }
    }

Variables:
    - 2 types:
        # Configuration variables: set $var 'something';
            - string, integers and booleans
        
        # NGINX module variables: $http, $uri, $args
          https://nginx.org/en/docs/varindex.html
    
    - Conditional:
        if ( $arg_apikey != 1234 ) {
            return 401 "Incorrect API key";
        }

        // $arg_apikey is query parameter 'apikey' value

        set $is_weekend 'no';
        if ( $date_local ~ 'Saturday|Sunday' ) {
            set $is_weekend 'yes';
        }
    
Rewrites and Redirects:
    * rewrite <regex pattern> <uri>
        - redirect changes the url to original one for user, rewrite keep what was given by user
        - rewrite gets the rewritten uri and re checks it in the configuration

        rewrite ^/user/(\w+) /greet/$1
        location /greet/john {
            return 200 'hello user'
        }
        // /greet url will be rewritten to ^/user/\w+ pattern

        # rewrite <regex pattern> <uri> last;
            - 'last' keyword marks the <uri> as rewritten for the last time


    * return <status> <return_value>
        - for 200: <return_value> is a string
        - for 300 (redirect): <return_value> is a uri

Try Files & Named Locations:
    * try_file <path1> <path2> ... <pathN> <final path>;
        - check if the path exist in root directory and serve it
        - it will keep checking the path and will serve the path that it found first

        - only <final path> is a rewrite. other paths are for file to search in root directory

        - if it finds a path to serve it will serve regardless of what the url was

    
    config file:
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name localhost;

        root /sites/demo;

        try_file $uri /serve_404;

        location = /serve_404 {
            return 404 "Not found";
        }
    }

    // this servers the incoming uri and if not found it servers 404

    * Named location:
        - used for locating a location by name instead of uri

        try_file @named_location;
        location @named_location {
            // something
        }


Logging:
    * Error Log: log any error
    * Access Log: any request/response log

    - logs are open by default
    - default log directory: /var/log/nginx/

    - custom logs:
        * access_log <path>, error_log <path>

        location /secure {
            access_log /var/log/nginx/secure.access.log
            return 200 "welcome";
        }
        - access log for /secure won't exist in global access log
        - can be sent to both global and custom log by adding access_log again to global log

        * access_log off;
            - disable access log for some context

Inheritence and Directive Types:
    - context inherits directives from it's parent context

    e.g:
        http{
            server{
                root /site/demo;
                location /something {
                    // something
                }
            }
        }
        - file context -> http context -> server context -> location context

    * 3 directive types:
        # standard directive
            - can be decleared once in a given context
            - inherited top down
            - redeclearing in child context will override parent directive

        # array directive:
            - can be decleared multiple times without overriting the previous
            - e.g access_log
            - inherited top down
            - redeclearing any in child context will override parent directive
        
        # action directive
            - break or action in confing
            - e.g return, rewrite, try_file

PHP Processing:
    - need to add a location context for php file to use the fpm socket

    # index directive:
        index <index file1> <index file2>;
        - to look for start html file when server is accessed without any following path
    
    # 'user' directive:
        user <user name>;
        - in file context to run nginx worker under that user

Worker Process:
    - worker process is launched by master process
    - worker process listens for and response to client process

    # 'worker_processes <number of process>' directive:
        worker_processes 2;
            - it will launch 2 worker processes
        
        - worker process runs on a single cpu core

        worker_processes auto;
            - one worker per core
    
    # 'worker_connections <number>' directive:
        events {
            worker_connections <number>;
        }
        - how many concurrent request a worker process can handle
        - number can be found by `ulimit -n`, return how many files can be open by each cpu core

        * worker_processes * worker_connections = max connections
    
    # 'pid <path>' directive:
        - can reconfigure the process id file location
        - default process id file /var/run/nginx.pid

Buffers & timeouts:
    - configurations for requests to the server

    * request -> nginx writes the data to memory (buffering) -> next steps
    * file -> loads into memory (buffering) -> serve from memory

    # client_body_buffer_size 10K;
        - buffer size for post data
        - 10K = 10KB
        - having it more that needed will cause unused memory
        - having it lower that needed, nginx will write part of it in disk
    
    # client_max_body_size 8M:
        - max size for post request body
        - larger than that will return 413 "request entity too large"

    # client_header_buffer_size 1k:
        - size for request header
    
    # client_body_timeout 12:
        - timeout between consicutive read operation of body by buffer
    
    # client_header_timeout 12:
        - timeout between consicutive read operation of header by buffer

    * timeout directive: 12 = 12ms, 12s = 12 seconds, 12m = mins, 12h = hours, 12d = days

    # keepalive_timeout 15;
        - how long nginx will keep the connection open between client and server in case more data in on the way
    
    # send_timeout 10:
        - if client doesn't receive respone in 10ms then abort sending the response all together
    
    # sendfile on:
        - when sending a file from disk don't put it in buffer(memory)
    
    # tcp_nopush on:
        - optimize sendfile packets

Dymanic Modules:
    - dynamic modules are modules that we can load selectively from nginx configuration
    - static modules are always loaded

    - dynamic modules directory: /etc/nginx/modules/

    * rebuild nginx:
        - `nginx -V` gives current configuration which shouldn'e be changed
        - `./configure --help` gives all the modules to load. dynamic modules ends with =dynamic
        - `./configure <all current configuarions> <dynamic module flag>` this will load the dynamic module into current
        build
        - reload nginx
        - 'load_module modules/...;' to load the dynamic module into configuration file
